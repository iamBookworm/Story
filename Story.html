		<h3> Aspects of a Short Story </h3>
			<div> There are five main aspects that go into a short story: character, setting, conflict, plot, and theme. They are meant to complement each other and prevent discrepancies from forming. It can be helpful to develop a basis of idea of each before writing.
		<h4> Plot </h4>

			<div> Plot is a series of events and character actions that relate to the central conflict. It exists as the <strong>why</strong> behind the conflict occuring within the story.
		<h4> Characters </h4> Characters are the heart of the story. They are <strong>who</strong> the story follows and the reasons behind the "why" of the plot. Characters can be dynamic or static. For main characters, readers usually prefer dynamic characters as they keep the story fresh and relatable.
			<div>
		<h4> Setting </h4>
			<div> Setting is an integral piece to writing a short story. Setting is the <strong>place and time</strong> of a story. Most likely, every action takes place in a different setting because most stories don't stay in the same place.
		<h4> Theme </h4>
			<div> This is the idea that the author wants the reader to understand at the end of the story. It's usually the author's thoughts or view on a subject.
		<h4> Conflict </h4>
			<div> Every story has a conflict. It gives the plot a reason to exist. Without it, the plot is stagnant, static, and unneeding of change. There are four different versions of conflict.
